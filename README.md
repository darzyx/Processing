# Processing Sketches

This is a repository of animated sketches that I've made using Python Mode for Processing. Source files are in .pyde format, corresponding to the Processing software sketchbook/language. I've added a folder with screenshots corresponding to each animation.

Haven't heard of Processing? Processing is a fun way for beginners to learn how to code by making beautiful pictures, animations, and interactive applets all by writing code in Java, Python, or a few other languages within Processing and alongside its libraries. I very much recommend checking out [https://processing.org/](https://processing.org/)!
